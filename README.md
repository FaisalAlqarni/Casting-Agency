### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7.9
Preferrably install Python 3.7.9

##### Set up a Virtual Enviornment
To create a virtual environment, go to your projectâ€™s directory and run venv. If you are using Python 2, replace venv with virtualenv in the below commands.

On macOS and Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```
On Windows:
```bash
py -m venv env
```


##### Activate a Virtual Enviornment
On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the **root directory** and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages within the `requirements.txt` file.


### Setting Up Project Locally

```
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE casting" "user=postgres dbname=postgres password=1111"
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE casting_test" "user=postgres dbname=postgres password=1111"
```

2. Configure the models.py / test_app.py with appropiate variables.
```
database_path ='postgresql://postgres:1111@localhost:5432/casting'
